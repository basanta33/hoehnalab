            <p class="lead">Welcome to the lab of Sebastian Höhna at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. Computer software that perform statistical analyses are essential to study evolutionary biology. Our primary aim is to develop new statistical models and computational methods to answer research questions in phylogenetics, which include: (1) estimating phylogenetic relationships; (2) estimating divergence times and rates of molecular evolution; (3) inferring rates and mode of lineage diversification (speciation and extinction); (4) analyzing causes of conflicting gene trees. All these topics have in common that they use phylogenies to represent evolutionary relationships.</p>
